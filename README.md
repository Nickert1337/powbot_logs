# powbot_logs
This little tool will make finding logs for your emulator or device easier. Scriptwriters greatly appreciate logs and it helps them debug/fix issues with their scripts.

# Help
## Emulator or device does not show up in devices list
Usually this means ADB is not enabled, so make sure ADB is enabled.

### Enabling ADB on LDPlayer:
Open settings for the emulator you are trying to see and make sure "ADB debugging" is on "open local connection"
